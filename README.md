# Rod Cutting Problem - C++ Implementations

This project demonstrates three different solutions to the classic **Rod Cutting** problem using:

- ✅ Recursive (without memoization)
- ✅ Top-Down Dynamic Programming (with memoization)
- ✅ Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (tabulation)

## 🧠 Problem Summary

Given a rod of length `n` and an array `price[]` where `price[i]` is the price of a rod of length `i`,
the goal is to determine the maximum total revenue obtainable by cutting the rod into smaller pieces
and selling them.

This problem is a variation of the **Unbounded Knapsack Problem**.

## 📦 Features

- Generates a random price list for rod lengths.
- Compares the output of all three algorithms.
- Verifies whether all approaches yield the same optimal result.
